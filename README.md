## Project Objective
Use SQL to analyze historical movie data and generate actionable recommendations for:
1. Target audience segmentation
2. Preferred genres and languages
3. Optimal release periods
4. Key success metrics for global hits

## Key Highlights:
1. Structured analysis across four business-driven segments
2. Deep dive into relationships between revenue, genre, cast, ratings, and more
3. Recommendations backed by solid SQL-based insights


##  Conclusiom:
RSVP Movies' global expansion strategy should focus on drama and romance genres,
which have shown high audience love. Collaborating with top directors like Joe and
Anthony Russo for drama or James Mangold for sci-fi could increase the project's
 profile. Casting well-performing actresses such as Emma Stone, Rooney Mara, and
 actors as Kin Wah Chew, or Chris Hemsworth would likely increase market appeal. To
 penetrate the global market effectively, RSVP Movies should consider partnering with
 established studios like Marvel Studios, Twentieth Century, or Warner Bros.
 Additionally, the company should explore the potential benefits and terms of partnering
 with a major studios in other countries to enhance their global distribution capabilities
 and market presence
